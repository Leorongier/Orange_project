<h1 align="center">Welcome to the Orange_project!</h1>

<h2 align="center">🌟 Project Context</h2>
<p align="center">Welcome to the Orange_project!</p>
<p align="center">
We are thrilled to introduce an application developed by Khadija Oukerroum and Léo Rongier, enthusiastic students from HEC Lausanne. Our journey began in 2023, with the aim of crafting a machine learning model capable of predicting the difficulty levels of French texts. We're inviting you to dive into this venture and witness the prowess of our model firsthand.
</p>

<h2 align="center">🔍 Methodology</h2>
Our approach involved experimenting with a variety of Machine Learning techniques:
<ul>
  
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Logistic Regression with Finetuned-Embedding</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression with Multilingual Embedding</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression with TF-IDF</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression with Bag-of-Words</li>
  <li>KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)</li>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
</ul>
Each method underwent rigorous testing to evaluate its effectiveness in predicting text difficulty.
</p>

<h2 align="center">📈 Results</h2>
<p align="center">
We achieved an accuracy score of 0.58, marking a commendable step forward towards creating efficient and precise language models.
