🌟 Project Context
Welcome to the Orange_project!

We are thrilled to introduce an application developed by Khadija Oukerroum and Léo Rongier, enthusiastic students from HEC Lausanne. Our journey began in 2023, with the aim of crafting a machine learning model capable of predicting the difficulty levels of French texts. We're inviting you to dive into this venture and witness the prowess of our model firsthand.

🔍 Methodology
Our approach involved experimenting with a variety of Machine Learning techniques:

Logistic Regression with Finetuned-Embedding
Logistic Regression with Multilingual Embedding
Logistic Regression with TF-IDF
Logistic Regression with Bag-of-Words
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Each method underwent rigorous testing to evaluate its effectiveness in predicting text difficulty.

📈 Results
We achieved an accuracy score of 0.58, marking a commendable step forward towards creating efficient and precise language models.
